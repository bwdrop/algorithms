Sorting algorithms in C++

## Requirements
- boost 1.65.1 (http://www.boost.org/)

## Build
```
make
```

## Usage
```sh
./sort [-n number] algorithm
```
- `number` is the number of elements to sort (defaults to 100)
- `algorithm` is the type of algorithm to use. Available algorithms are:
  - bubble
  - selection
  - insertion
  - merge
  - quick

## TODO list
- [ ] add sort algorithm visualization
- [ ] update README to include algorithm explanation
- [ ] add new algorithms
